# 🚀 Pre-Placement Platform

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Pre-Placement Platform** is a full-stack web application designed to centralize placement preparation. Students can practice **company-specific coding questions, track performance, and visualize progress — all in one place**.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

* Single platform for placement preparation
* Company-wise + Topic-wise practice
* Track user performance with analytics
* Eliminate duplicate effort (LeetCode-style tracking)
* (Future) AI-driven recommendations

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

### 🔹 Backend

* FastAPI (Python)
* SQLAlchemy ORM
* JWT Authentication

### 🔹 Frontend

* React.js
* Axios
* Monaco Editor
* Recharts (Charts)
* React Calendar Heatmap

### 🔹 Databases

* PostgreSQL → Users, authentication, attempts
* MongoDB → Questions (coding + aptitude)
